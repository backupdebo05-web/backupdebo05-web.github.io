  <h2>About Peace Thrives</h2>

  <p>
    Peace Thrives LLC operates as a residential housing provider and also offers
    non-medical support services such as light housekeeping, errands, and related
    non-medical assistance. We do not provide healthcare services, personal medical
    assistance, or medical supervision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Individuals seeking residential accommodation with us must be capable of
    independent living and managing their own daily activities. Residents who
    require medical or personal care services must make their own arrangements
    with qualified providers. Non-medical support services may be offered under
    a separate agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>
  <p>
    Our vision is to create safe, stable, and respectful residential living
    environments where adults can thrive with dignity, independence, and a
    strong sense of community.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is to provide quality private and shared residential housing
    accommodations while supporting independent living through structured,
    non-medical support services that promote stability, responsibility, and
    personal growth.
  </p>

  <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
  <p>
    Peace Thrives serves adults who are capable of independent living and are
    seeking private or shared residential housing accommodations. Our housing
    options are designed for individuals who value a supportive living
    environment but do not require medical, nursing, or personal care services.
